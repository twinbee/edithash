This is the EditHash application originally created by ClodHopper in ~2012 to update the dfwhhh.org website of the combined kennels of the Dallas Hash House Harriers.

This version is updated to run with JDK's associated with modern Java, meaning Java 8 and newer, and OpenJDK as well.

It has also been given a maven build system, and source code for use by any kennels wanting a similar set-up.

Future work may include a new native mobile or WebApp.
